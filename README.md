Summary: The process from finding contours to determining answer positions in the code begins with detecting contours in the edge-processed image and filtering for the contour with four points to identify the test area. Next, the image is transformed to a bird's eye view for easier processing. The image is then thresholded to create a binary image, allowing for the identification and storage of contours corresponding to appropriately sized answer choices. These contours are sorted top to bottom and analyzed to find which bubble is marked the most. Finally, the code compares the selected bubble to the correct answer and calculates the score based on the accuracy of the responses.
